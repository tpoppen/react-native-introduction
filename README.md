# react-native-introduction
Sample react-native demo application.

## About this Repo
This React Native demo application is built with Expo. It is meant to be a fairly bare example project to introduce people to React Native with examples of basic functionality to get people off the ground. It provides a foundation of user interaction state management and base navigation to let developers start playing with the framework and experiment/explore/add on at the developers' desired pace.

If you want to experiment with raw react-native you can eject this application and still utilize `ExpoKit`. To do this run `expo eject` and follow the instructions here: https://docs.expo.io/versions/v32.0.0/expokit/eject/
